# Image-Optimization
In this project we are going to learn how to resize an image taken through a form, with the help of php 

first of all configure your php.ini file and assign the max Size as per your wish, here  in this case it is taken as 400 MB


; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
upload_max_filesize = 400M

; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize
post_max_size = 400M
